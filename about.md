# About

Hi, I am Daniel Sobien, an academic researcher in the field of AI and machine learning. I want to take a shift on this blog and discuss how artificial intelligence (AI) intertwines with our personal lives and take a philosophical view of the technology. 

AI is fast growing and has the potential to impact every facet of our lives in the next few years, at the same time it is offering a different perspective on what it means to be human, from intelligence, to ethics, and even privacy. There are as many opportunities for us to determine who we want to be as a society as there are technological advances to improve our lives. I do not believe the philosophical side of AI is explored and discussed enough, and so I want to focus on it in this blog.
