## Hello, World!

Hello and welcome to my blog. I'm Daniel Sobien and here I discuss topics like artificial intelligence (AI), philosophy, programming, tech in general, and how all these topics are intertwined and impact our lives. I am just in the starting process and will be posting more content soon.

# Can I add a page (and link here) for a reading list, so I can cover books I've read and recommend, and maybe even what I'm currently reading?
